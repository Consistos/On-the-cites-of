<h3>Raison d’être<h3></h3>

<p>When reading an interesting publication, I often try to see further if the idea(s) exposed in it have been further developed, combined with others, mentioned or acknowledge in other ones. Google Scholar allows finding which paper have cited it, but most of these are often loosely related and not specific to the main topic of the article.

This website is designed to search for subsequent publications that have high chances of mixing the subjects of each the submitted one, and increase the chance that they are specifically related to the sought subject.

It uses the opencitation API to recover.<p/>
